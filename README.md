> Script Info

Simple standalone **DEV** resource that allows you to preview/test the new chameleon paints.
This resource is not created for live use and I won't provide support for implementing them in your scripts,  but if you have any other questions you can always message me.

```
Use /enter for the menu to open (ox_lib) only
``` 



```
Use /setpaints [1-maxpaints] if you don't use ox_lib

Example :

/setpaint 7
``` 

```
/loop - Will loop though all the available paints on your build
```

For GameBuild 2545 there are only 6 paints
For GameBuild 2699/2802 there are 65 paints

**Setup:**
You need to be on GameBuild 2545/2699/2802 for paints to work
The script has to be started before you connect to the server otherwise you won't see the paints
